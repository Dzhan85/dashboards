# Legacy Dashboards

> **NOTICE**
>
> In this directory you will find legacy dashboards used in early revisions of
> Service Telemetry Framework. These dashboards are not expected to work with
> the current iterations of Service Telemetry Framework.
>
> These dashboards remain here for reference without needing to dig back
> through git history to find them. Eventually the knowledge they provide will
> be rolled back into the provided dashboarding work, and this directory should
> eventually go away.
